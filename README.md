# Python_mini_projects

This repository is a collection of various Python projects that span across different domains and levels of complexity. The projects are designed to provide practical experience in programming and showcase the features of each project, from simple quiz games to more advanced password manager.

The quiz game asks a series of questions and provides feedback on the player's performance. The password manager, on the other hand, allows users to create a secure storage system for their login credentials, using encryption techniques to keep the data safe.

This repository also includes a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game, where users can create their own interactive story and allow players to make choices that determine the outcome of the story.

The "Number Guesser" project is another fun game that allows users to create a program that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it. The program provides feedback on each guess and informs the user whether they need to guess higher or lower.

Lastly, the repository also includes a classic game of "Rock Paper Scissors." This project involves creating a program that allows users to play against the computer and keep track of the score.
